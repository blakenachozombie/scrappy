# scrappy
This is an incredibly stupid python AI. I made it for fun.

When the program starts running, it will ask your name. Then it will either flip your name backwards, or greet
you normally. Then, you can talk to Scrappy. Scrappy is just stupid. I designed him to be like that.

Try and have an actual conversation with the robot. It's possible, I think.

Some things Scrappy will respond normally to, like "Hi" or "Bye" and a questions like "where are you from?" 
or "how are you?"

Apart from that, Scrappy is an idiot.
